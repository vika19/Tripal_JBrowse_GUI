Installation and Configuration:
1) unpack the module into /sites/all/modules
2) go to module menu and enable the module
3) go to the module menu and click configuration
4) enter the absolute path (starting with root /) to the JBrowse installation, the default being /var/www/html/jbrowse/
5) enter the name of the JBrowse installation directory, which defaults to jbrowse.  If you did not change it when you installed it, it may be JBrowse-1.12.3, etc.  
6) Save configuration

Set Permissions:
1) go to people menu
2) click the permissions tab
3) scroll to popupjb
4) set the permissions for access to the three functions, add a reference/load a track/delete a track.  Suggested use would be locking reference loading and track removal to admins and track loading to authorized users only.

Use:
Three pages are available in the module:
/popupjb_ref	
	- allows you to upload a .fa or .fasta file as a reference file as well as name the reference
/popupjb_track 
	- allows you to upload .bam/.gff/.gff3/.bed/.vcf/.gbk files against a preloaded reference and 	name the tracks.
	- this does allow access to ANY open preloaded jbrowse.  If there is a jbrowse you do not want 	to be modified, you can easily change the permissions of that directory to not be writable by 	apache/www-data
/popupjb_delete
	- allows you to delete uploaded tracks for clean up, etc.

Notes:  File types are checked at upload, upload max is set in php.ini
